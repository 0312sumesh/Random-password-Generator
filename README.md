 Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months.
 Passwords provide the first line of defense against unauthorized access to your computer and personal information.
 The stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software. 
 You should maintain strong passwords for all accounts on your computer.
 
 Here, this Program generates a Random password which is complex.
 Strong passwords are utterly important â€“ they prevent unauthorized access to your electronic accounts and devices. 
 ... So, the more complex your password is, the more security it provides for your account.
 The key aspects of a strong password are length (the longer the better);
 a mix of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols, no ties to your personal information, and no dictionary words.
